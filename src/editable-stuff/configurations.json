  "aboutDescription": "Hello! My name is Mauro, and I am an Engineer with a Master on Business Intelligence and Analytics. I work as a Consultant at Datagroup GmbH, and I use Azure and SAP for Analytics and Data Science projects. I have extensive experience leading projects and I have occupied Senior positions in big tech companies. In many occasions I coordinate multiple cross-functional teams to meet the project deadlines. Leading is part of my character but I also enjoy working independently crunching data and making models. Day by day I built up stronger my skills in Analytics and Data Science. My hobbies are retro computing, ride my bicycle long distances, and long walks in the forest. Now I am living in the south of Germany enjoying the challenges of living in a different culture and learning a new language. Today, I am very interested in the use of Data and AI as fundamental building block of our daily life",
